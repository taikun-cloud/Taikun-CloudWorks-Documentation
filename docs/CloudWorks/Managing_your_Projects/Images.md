A Kubernetes Image is a container image that is deployed and managed within the cluster, which includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configurations.

To access your project images, follow these steps:

1. At the **Overview** tab, select **Projects**.
2. Choose your **Project**.
3. Select **VMs** at your Project page.
