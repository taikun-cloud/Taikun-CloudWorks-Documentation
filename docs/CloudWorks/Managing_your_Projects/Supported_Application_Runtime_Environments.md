# **Supported Application Runtime Environments**

Integrating NVIDIA GPU acceleration and Wasm in Taikun CloudWorks offers a comprehensive platform that caters to diverse computing needs, providing versatility, performance optimization, seamless container integration, monitoring capabilities, and security measures for GPU-accelerated workloads.

**Runc** (pronounced “run-see”) is a lightweight, portable container runtime that is part of the Open Container Initiative (OCI). It is designed to be a universal container runtime that can run containers conforming to the OCI specification. Runc is often used as the default runtime for container engines like Docker. It provides the basic functionality needed to run containers, such as creating and managing container processes, setting up namespaces and control groups, and managing container filesystems.
