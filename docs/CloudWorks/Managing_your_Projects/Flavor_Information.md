Sort flavors by the size of CPU and RAM or use the search bar.

!!! Note
	To use a flavor for a server in a project, you must assign the flavor to the project first. This can be done during project creation or in the **Flavor Info** tab.

## **Binding a Flavor to a Project**

Choose the **Organization, Cloud Type, and Credentials** where your project is stored. After selecting a flavor, you can bind it to the project.

If the flavor is already bound to the project, an **error message** will be displayed.

## **Viewing and Unbinding Flavors**

To view all flavors used in projects, use the **"Flavor-Project Bounds"** button.
Flavors for each cloud provider (**Amazon, Azure, OpenStack**) can be sorted by:

- **Name**
- **Project Name**
- **CPU**
- **RAM**

To unbind a flavor from a specific project, select a **Cloud**, choose the project-flavor pair, and click the **"Unbind Flavor"** button.
