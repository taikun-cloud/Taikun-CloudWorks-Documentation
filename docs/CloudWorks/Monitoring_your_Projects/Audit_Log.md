You get real-time notifications via [**Inbox**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Taikun_Notifications/) but you can also preview all the changes made in the Audit Log. The Audit Log can be located under the [**Manager**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Navigating_in_Taikun/Manager/) section of your account.

See who (User Name) made a change (Category, Message), where (Project), and what time (When). Choose Start and End dates, Hours, and Minutes for filtering if needed.
