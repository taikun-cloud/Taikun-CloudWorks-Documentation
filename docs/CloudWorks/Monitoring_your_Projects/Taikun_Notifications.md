Whenever any User of your Organization makes a change (e.g. creating a Project, adding a Backup, deleting a cluster), you will be notified in Taikun’s Notifications menu, accessible from every page.

## **Audit Log**

The [**Audit Log**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Audit_Log/) is a feature that allows you to view a complete history of events in your account. It provides a detailed record of actions taken by users, such as creating servers and Projects, adding new users, and activating Monitoring tools.

One of the great features of the Audit Log is that you can filter the events by date, project, user, action type, and Project availability. This allows you to narrow down the events to a specific period, project, user, or action, making it easier to find the information you’re looking for.

If you need to track changes made to your account or audit the activity happening in your account, the Audit Log is an invaluable tool. Head to the Audit Log section from your Inbox and use the filters to view the most relevant events.

## **Email notifications**

Taikun also has the ability to send notifications to your email address in order to help you monitor the state of your Kubernetes clusters. By setting up these notifications, you can stay informed about the status of your clusters and take action if any issues arise.

To enable the notifications, head to the [**My Profile**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Account_Management/My_Profile_management/) page and toggle the “E-mail notifications” switch on.
