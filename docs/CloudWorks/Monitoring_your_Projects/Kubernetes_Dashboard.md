# **Kubernetes dashboard**
:fontawesome-solid-user-tie: Manager | :fontawesome-regular-handshake: Partner

At your Project page, select **"Dashboard"**.

The Dashboard is available for your Project if monitoring is enabled. You can read more about monitoring [**here**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Enable_Monitoring_in_Projects/).

At least four nodes are required. Read more details about cluster creation [**here**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Getting_Started/Creating_Kubernetes_cluster/).

Users can compare metrics across different periods and namespaces without the need for extensive command-line knowledge by using Prometheus queries (PromQL). It helps monitor resource utilization, enabling effective capacity planning and allocation.

## **Taikun Tab**

On Cluster Dashboard you can find:

### Node Overview
Display information about cluster nodes, such as CPU and memory utilization, pod count, and other relevant metrics.

### Pod Overview
Show the status of pods within the project, including their current state, restart counts, and resource usage.

### Overcommitment
CPU and Memory overcommit.

You can define a specific time range.
