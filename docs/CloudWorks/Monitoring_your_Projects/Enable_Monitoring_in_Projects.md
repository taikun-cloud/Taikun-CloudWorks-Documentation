Some of the features described in the [**Available Monitoring Tools**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Available_Monitoring_tools/) are accessible only if a Project has Monitoring enabled. With this step, you connect your Project to other open-source projects, such as Grafana and Prometheus, to access advanced monitoring instruments. With their help, you will be able to quickly determine a reason for the cluster’s failure or quickly define existing bottlenecks that can be re-configured to improve the speed of your product.

## **Enable Monitoring**

There are 2 options for the activation of Monitoring tools:

### Enable monitoring during the Project creation

![Enable Monitoring](https://rgw.cloudpoint.tcpro.cz/swift/v1/KEY_0efe203c42c0402f9402a570302dc066/new-docs/monitoring-your-projects/enable%20monitoring/monitoring.webp)

### Alternatively, it can be activated in the already created Projects

The process might take up to 2 minutes. Upon successful activation, you will be able to work with the *Logs*, *Alerts*, and *Metrics* menus of your Project.
