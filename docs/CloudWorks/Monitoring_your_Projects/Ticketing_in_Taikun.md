## **Transfer Ticket**

Transfer the ticket to another user e.g. if you think he’s more reliable to take care of the ticket. The ticket can be transferred to another user (Manager or Partner) from your Organization in the sections:

* New
* Open
* Closed

---

## **How to deal with open status**

Once a ticket is in the Open section, it is already taken care of or is waiting for the problem to be solved. You can add a comment to the ticket and you can do so only in Open status.

Once the problem is solved you can transfer it to Closed.

After the issue is solved, a member of our team will transfer the ticket to Archived.
