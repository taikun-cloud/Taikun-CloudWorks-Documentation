# **Usage Reports**

You can use the Usage Reports tab to monitor the usage of Cloud resources. In every *Project*, you can see the number of used TCUs (Taikun Compute Units) for a selected period limited by *Start Date* and *End Date*.

Sort data by *Project* or *TCU* and filter them by choosing available or deleted projects.

## **TCU**

* Indicates the amount of resources spent by Taikun to manage your resources
* Total CPUs and GB of RAM used in a Project (TCU = 1 vCPU or TCPU = 1GB of RAM)
