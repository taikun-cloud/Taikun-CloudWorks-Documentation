# **Partner**
:fontawesome-regular-handshake: Partner

The *Partner* section is designed for our strategic partners. It provides access to several additional features related to managing organizations. These features help partners efficiently manage their affiliated organizations and streamline their operations.

## **Organizations**

Organize your account structure with [Organizations](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Account_Management/Organizations_in_Taikun/), which can be linked to specific users, projects, and credentials. Organizations also help you get a better overview of each supported site, which can be selected via the dropdown menu.

## **Billing Rules**

With **Billing Rules**, you can create new rules to calculate customers' cloud usage based on specific metrics and assign them to any available organization. The final result can be viewed in the [**Chargeback**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Chargeback/) menu.

Rules can be sorted by:

- **Name**
- **Metric Name**
- **Creation Date**
- **Rule Type**
