## **Chargeback**

The [**Chargeback**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Chargeback/) tab is an overview of prices for every billing rule you set up in your account. The Billing Rules calculate your usage from the moment they have been assigned to an Organization and indicate used TCUs for a defined period. Changing the Start and End dates allows you to adjust the measured period to monitor the exact spending.
