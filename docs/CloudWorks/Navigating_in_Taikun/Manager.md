## **Project Quotas**

Coordinate quotas (limits) for resources of your Projects. If specified, your Projects will have a limit on the number of vCPUs, RAM, and Volume used. Taikun sets its default quotas in the beginning – it can be configured at any point manually.

Project Quotas allow you to control the usage of resources that each Project can spend. Read more about that in the [**Project Quotas article**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Project_Quotas/).

## **Servers**

View and manage the [**Servers**](https://docs.taikun.cloud/CloudWorks/Monitoring_your_Projects/Live_Servers/) being used in your Projects. The all-inclusive table provides a quick overview of the instances created with Taikun’s help. Regardless of the number of Projects created in your instance, you can always access this menu to understand the condition of servers within one list.

The table can be filtered by a Cloud Provider and by servers’ resources (CPU, RAM, Disk Size)
