# **Scope of Support from Taikun CloudWorks**

## **The support provided by Taikun CloudWorks covers the following areas**

*  **Deployment of Kubernetes Clusters**
Support is offered for the deployment of Kubernetes clusters, including selecting the appropriate environment for implementation, configuring, and deploying basic cluster components. This process involves validating compatibility and ensuring the correct functioning of the deployed cluster within the Taikun CloudWorks environment. The primary focus is on ensuring basic management and validation of the cluster for production or development operations.

* **Application Installation**
Our support includes assistance with the standard deployment of applications on the platform. This encompasses guidance on initial configuration, integration with relevant resources on the platform, and ensuring smooth initial operation according to standard deployment procedures. Supported scenarios include deploying compatible software packages and components that facilitate quick activation and reduce potential technical issues.

* **Virtual Cluster Deployment**
Support is available for the deployment and basic configuration of virtual clusters. This involves setting up isolated environments for workloads within the platform, ensuring the correct configuration for resource allocation and network isolation across clusters.

* **Grafana Setup and Monitoring**
Our support includes the setup and configuration of Grafana for monitoring and visualizing performance metrics. We assist in integrating Grafana with existing services and ensuring it provides the necessary dashboards for observability and alerting.

* **Backup Solutions**
We assist in setting up standard backup solutions to ensure that data and configurations are regularly backed up in accordance with industry best practices. This includes guidance on configuring backup schedules, retention policies, and restoring data when necessary.

* **Prometheus Integration and Setup**
Our support extends to the setup and configuration of Prometheus for monitoring and collecting time-series data. We help ensure Prometheus is properly integrated with the system to monitor infrastructure, applications, and services, providing the necessary metrics for performance tuning and alerting.

* **AI Integration and Support**
We provide support for integrating AI-related tools and services within the Taikun CloudWorks environment. This includes assisting with the setup of machine learning workflows, deploying AI models, and ensuring AI tools are properly configured and optimized for use in cloud environments.

* **General Support and Consultation**
Users are offered general technical support focused on easing their work with the platform. This includes providing advice, consulting on the best options within Taikun CloudWorks, and recommending relevant sources of information, such as documentation or user guides. The goal is to provide direction and answer basic questions related to system functionality.

## **Areas NOT Covered by Support**

* **Internal Application and Environment Configuration**
Support does not extend to modifications that occur within applications or specific settings in user environments. Such modifications may involve particular network parameters, storage settings, or other customizations that exceed standard deployments.

* **Installations with Non-Standard Parameters**
Support is limited to standard and verified installations of applications. Cases where installations require special or custom parameters fall outside the scope of provided support. Functionality cannot be guaranteed in such scenarios, nor can detailed assistance be offered for related issues.

* **Advanced Modifications of Kubernetes Clusters**
Special configurations and customizations of Kubernetes, such as the implementation of specific role-based access control (RBAC) policies or customized deployments, are not included within standard support. These changes often require deeper technical expertise and must be addressed by users independently.

* **Virtual Machine (VM) Configuration and Customization**
Detailed configuration of virtual machines, including network modifications, operating system adjustments, or other advanced changes within VMs, falls outside the scope of general support. These configurations need to be handled in accordance with user requirements and outside the range of standard intervention.

* **Incorrect Configuration of AI**
Taikun CloudWorks does not support incorrect configurations of AI services. Users are responsible for ensuring that AI tools and services are properly set up and configured within the platform. Misconfigurations will not be supported or fixed by our team.

## **Summary**
Taikun CloudWorks support focuses on the external aspects of assistance, including application installation, Kubernetes cluster deployment, Grafana, Prometheus, backup solutions, AI integration, virtual clusters, and general guidance. When it comes to internal configurations, advanced customizations, or specific settings within systems and applications, our support ends, and it is the responsibility of users to manage these processes either independently or through their own technical teams.
