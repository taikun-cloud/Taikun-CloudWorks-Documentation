Organizations in Taikun allow users to be grouped and share information. This feature helps businesses or groups collaborate and share resources within the platform.

- Users are assigned to organizations, and each organization can include multiple users.
- Information and resources are visible only within the assigned organization, ensuring data separation and security.
- **Partners** can manage multiple teams or businesses efficiently by grouping users into organizations.
- Organizations are managed by **Partners**, with a **Manager-owner** responsible for daily operations, Credentials, and Projects.
