# **Taikun OCP Baremetal Keycloak integration**

**Introduction:**

This feature aims to integrate the solution with the Identity Provider (IdP) Keycloak. The integration leverages the SAML 2.0 protocol to enable Taikun OCP Baremetal to utilize external authentication and authorization services provided by Keycloak.

**Overview:**

Taikun OCP Baremetal possesses the capability to incorporate external Identity Providers through the industry-standard Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0. By integrating with Keycloak as the IdP, the system gains access to robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, enhancing security and user management capabilities.

**Keycloak Identity Provider Integration:**

The integration process involves configuring Taikun OCP Baremetal to communicate with Keycloak’s SAML 2.0 endpoints. This encompasses the establishment of trust between the two systems and mapping of attributes to ensure seamless user authentication and authorization.
