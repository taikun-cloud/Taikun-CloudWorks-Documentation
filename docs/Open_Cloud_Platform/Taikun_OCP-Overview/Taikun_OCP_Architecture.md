# **Taikun OCP Architecture**

The Taikun OCP platform built on open-source principles, is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution catering to the management and orchestration of computing, storage, and networking resources. Its architecture comprises diverse components, each fulfilling distinct functions and offering the flexibility of independent or combined usage to deliver a comprehensive cloud experience. Operated on an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) foundation, Taikun OCP ensures consistent and automated deployment processes, streamlining cloud infrastructure management.

Engineered for scalability and fault tolerance, Taikun OCP excels in managing large-scale cloud environments with high availability. Its distributed architecture facilitates horizontal scaling by seamlessly adding nodes to the infrastructure. Moreover, Taikun OCP incorporates various high availability features, including automatic failover and load balancing.

Deployed as a containerized platform atop the Kubernetes orchestration platform, Taikun OCP leverages containerization and Kubernetes orchestration to optimize resource utilization, scalability, resilience, deployment simplicity, and ecosystem integration.
