## **Key Features**

1. **Customized Deployment:** This customization extends to our Automatic Migration feature, enhancing the resilience of your cloud infrastructure.

2. **Host Health Monitoring:** Our platform incorporates a sophisticated host health monitoring solution. This custom-built feature continuously assesses the status of each host within the Taikun OCP environment, proactively identifying potential failures before they impact your VMs.

3. **Automatic VM Migration:** In the unfortunate event of a host failure, Taikun OpenCloud Platform’s Automatic Migration feature swings into action. All VMs hosted on the affected host are seamlessly and automatically migrated to a healthy host, ensuring minimal disruption to your services.

## **How It Works**

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** The host health monitoring solution runs in the background, constantly evaluating the status of each host in the Taikun OCP deployment.

2. **Failure Detection:** Upon detecting a potential failure, the system triggers an alert and initiates the Automatic Migration process.

3. **Efficient Migration:** Taikun Open Cloud Platform orchestrates the migration of all VMs from the affected host to a healthy one, optimizing the allocation of resources to maintain performance levels.
